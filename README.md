# tic-tac-toe
Created a tic-tac-toe game in Python took 1 afternoon.
Next step is to add a gui and a computer that doesn't make random choices.

Each new game file will be an improved version of the game hopefully ending with an ML version of the game.
A gui will be created at some level most likely before the ML stage.
